# purethaicookhouse-specials
My colleague Nathan likes to go to Pure Thai Cookhouse for lunch. He checks the website every day for lunch specials. And one day I told him let's write a script to do that and email us automatically.

Script is Node.js based and uses SendGrid for sending email.

#### Instructions
1. Download source
2. npm install
3. export SENDGRID_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'
4. node run.js

#### Notes
* Step 1 & 2 are first time only, and requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.
* Step 3: Environment variable to send email; replace with actual API key from SendGrid account.
